# Game Of Life

The Game Of Life is a [cell life simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) devised by the Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

The simulator serves as an excellent coding example to learn new programming languages. The rules are simple. You have a grid in a predetermined size, each cell can live or die based on a set of rules:

- If a cell is alive, and there are 0 or 1 living neighbors, the cell dies of loneliness.
- If a cell is alive, and there are 2 or 3 living neighbors, the cell survives.
- If a cell is alive, and there are 4 or more living neighbors, the cell dies of overpopulation.
- If a cell is dead, and there are 3 living neighbors, the cell comes alive.

This is an example of a simple game of life implementation in various languages. The simulation uses the console output to visualize the game progress.
